  <h2>I'd like to tell you a little bit about me</h2>

  <main>
    Here are some fun facts about my life:
    <ol>
      <li>I have never learned to play guitar, even though I've taken lessons.</li>
      <li>I brew beer at home (don't worry, sterilization is part of the brewing process).</li>
      <li>I own an extremely rare breed of dog. He is absolutely my spoiled baby. </li>
      <li>I play Dungeons&Dragons unironically, like the huge geek I am.</li>
      <li>I love to visit haunted places, and recently went to a haunted lighthouse (Heceta Head in Oregon).</li>
    </ol>
